# Apple Games

This repository contains the source code for five iOS game prototypes created using Swift and SpriteKit.

## Games

1.  **Clone Armies - Tactical Game:** A 2D tactical shooter with a unique cloning mechanic.
2.  **Idle Siege: Army Tycoon Game:** An idle tycoon game where you manage an army base and conquer islands.
3.  **Tactile Wars:** A strategy game where you lead colorful soldiers using gesture-based controls.
4.  **One Clone Left:** A cooperative multiplayer game where you fight zombies and mutants.
5.  **My clone army: me, myself & I:** A multiplayer battlefield game where you build an army of your own clones.

## How to Run

To run any of the games, open the corresponding folder in Xcode and run the project on an iOS simulator or a physical device. For example, to run "Clone Armies", open the `CloneArmies` folder in Xcode.

**Note:** You will need to provide your own sound and music files for the games to have audio. The placeholder files are not included in this repository.

## Running Unit Tests

Each game has a `Tests` folder containing a basic set of unit tests. To run the tests, open the corresponding project in Xcode and press `Cmd+U`.
